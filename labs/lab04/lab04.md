# Lab 04 Report

2. The four essential freedoms are the freedom to run the program for any
purpose, the freedom to study how the program works and modify it, the
freedom to redistribute it, and the freedom to distribute modified versions
of it.

3. Choosing a license is important so that people know how to use your software
legally. A project is essentially useless to the public without a license, as
people will have no idea what they are allowed to do with it.

4. When a project doesn't have a license, it under copyright by default. This
means that you have no permission to copy, modify, distribute, or even use the
software. You should avoid using a project that has no license because in doing
so, you may be at risk of litigation.

5. I agree, it sounds like Gopher made some mistakes along the way that they were
unable to recover from. A significant one was trying to do too much on their
own, rather than letting the community help decide what the right path was. An
example of this is requiring payment of a licensing fee for .com domains, a
decision that the "hacker community" disagreed with.

6. Linux was developed as a reaction to MINIX, a Unix-like operating system for
academic use. The source code for MINIX was available, however modifying or
distributing it was not allowed. Linux was meant to change this, so it makes
sense that Linux would use a permissive license like the GPL that allows
commercial use, modifying, and distributing. Additionally, Linux used GNU
components that were licensed under the GPL. Sources:
