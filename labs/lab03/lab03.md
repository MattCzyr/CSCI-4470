The results of `gitstats` are a bit different than the stats from `git`, but
they're in the same ballpark. For example, 33 contributors vs. 39 contributors,
and ~62,000 lines of code vs. ~53,000 lines of code.

After running GitStats, we note a difference in the Contributors, also denoted as *Authors*.  
GitStats reports that there are 18 Authors when Git only revealed 10. Further, the Git
command on line 5 of this document yielded 37207 lines of code in Rpi Campus Map; GitStats
yielded 21118 lines of code (46245 added, 25127 removed).

The `gitstats` page seems to correlate pretty well with my findings, the lines of code is a bit off but I guess that's to be expected.
